# Surface Duo - Xamarin samples

This repo contains Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms Android samples for Surface Duo.

## Get Started

To learn how to load your app on to emulator, and to use it, refer to the [Surface Duo docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen) and [Xamarin.Forms dual-screen docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dual-screen/).

## Build and Test

To use the DualView and ExtendCanvas samples, you will first need to create an Google Map API key. Follow the instructions outlined [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to create an API key.

After you have an API key, put it in the following files:

- DualView/Resources/Assets/googlemap.html
- ExtendCanvas/Resources/Assets/googlemapsearch.html
- XamarinForms/Xamarin.Duo.Forms.Samples.Android/Assets/googlemap.html
- XamarinForms/Xamarin.Duo.Forms.Samples.Android/Assets/googlemapsearch.html

By replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` string with your actual key the map views will be displayed.
